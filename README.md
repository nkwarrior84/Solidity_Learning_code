# Solidity_Learning_code

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. ... Solidity was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

# Language paradigms: 

Object-oriented programming

# Solidity Development supports the following data types:

Integers: Solidity can support both unsigned and signed integer domains. For example, keywords like “uint256” can be used for allocating sizes of 256 bits and it also supports runtime exceptions.

Booleans: The datatype boolean returns the value “0” as false and “1” as true, depending on the accuracy of a condition. The output is usually generated as a boolean value when the logical operators are used.

Modifiers: Modifiers are used to identify the consistency of the conditions before the smart contract’s code is executed.
String Literals: String literals can be either represented with double or single quotes.

# Tools that can be used by Solidity Developers for building Solidity based smart contracts:
Solgraph: It is used for generating a DOT graph which visualizes function control flow of the Solidity contract and states security vulnerabilities.

Solidity REPL: Solidity REPL is used for writing command line codes on Solidity Console.

EVM Lab: It is a rich tool package that comes with an ability to interact with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It includes Etherchain API, trace-viewer and a VM.

Evmdis: Evmdis stands for EVM Disassembler that can perform static analysis on the bytecode to offer a higher level of abstraction as compared to raw EVM operations.
